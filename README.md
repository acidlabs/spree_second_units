SpreeSecondUnits
================

Spree extension that supports discounts that apply to units of the same product, enabling a new promotion actions calculator.

SecondUnits calculator
----------------------

This calculator has two preference: `percent` and `units`, and can be set like this:

```ruby
calculator.preferred_percent = 10
calculator.preferred_units   = 2
```

This calculator takes a `LineItem` and calculates an amount using this calculation:

```
[item price] x [percent] x [number of units with discount]
```

For example, if the calculator was configured to have 50 percent off over **second unit** (preferred_units=2) and the product has a price of $15.0

NÂº Items of same product | Formule | Discount
:----------------------: | ------- | -------:
1 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 0 | $0,0
2 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 1 | $7,5
3 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 1 | $7,5
4 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 2 | $15,0
5 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 2 | $15,0
6 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 3 | $22,5
17 | 15.0 x 0.5 x 8 | $60,0
